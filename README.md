- Hello, This is the repository for our Project in which we've trained a Financial Sentiment Analysis model using Bert for Borsa Istanbul. Knowing live alternatives cost more than 750 TL for a month this project will be further upgraded as a live open-source alternative to its rivals.   

- Here you can find the code of the data gathering, parsing, model training and visualizations in different folders.
All the documentation is public and open-source.
This sheet will be updated, but for the moment
let's get a good grade :)
